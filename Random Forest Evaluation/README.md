- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies for running the notebook

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **model evaluation and interpretation** rather than achieving the highest accuracy. It demonstrates how to properly assess regression model performance through multiple lenses:

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Multiple metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²) with practical interpretation
- **Residual Analysis**: Distribution analysis and systematic bias detection
- **Feature Importance**: Understanding which variables drive predictions
- **Visualization**: Actual vs predicted plots, residual plots, and feature importance charts
- **Business Context**: Interpretation of results in real-world housing market terms
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Impact of skewed distributions and clipped values

## Dataset Information

**California Housing Dataset** from scikit-learn:
- **Source**: 1990 US Census data
- **Target**: Median house values in hundreds of thousands of dollars
- **Features**: 8 attributes including median income, house age, average rooms, location coordinates
- **Size**: ~20,000 samples
- **Challenge**: Positively skewed target with clipped values at $500k

## Learning Objectives

After working through this notebook, you will be able to:

1. **Implement Random Forest Regression** with scikit-learn
2. **Calculate and interpret** key regression metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²)
3. **Perform residual analysis** to identify model biases and limitations
4. **Analyze feature importance** and relate findings to domain knowledge
5. **Create effective visualizations** for model evaluation
6. **Understand Random Forest characteristics** regarding data scaling, skewness, and outliers
7. **Identify data quality issues** and their impact on model performance

## Key Insights from Analysis

### Model Performance
- **R² Score**: ~0.80 (explains 80% of variance)
- **Mean Absolute Error**: ~$33,220
- **Root Mean Squared Error**: ~$50,630
- **Systematic Bias**: Over-predicts low-value homes, under-predicts high-value homes

### Feature Importance Rankings
1. **MedInc** (Median Income) - Most important predictor
2. **Latitude/Longitude** - Location is crucial (combined importance)
3. **AveOccup** (Average Occupancy) - Density/neighborhood factor
4. **HouseAge, AveRooms, Population, AveBedrms** - Secondary factors

### Random Forest Characteristics
- **Robust to skewed data** (unlike linear regression)
- **No standardization needed** (unlike KNN/SVM)
- **Handles outliers well** through ensemble averaging
- **Feature importance** provides business insights

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Setup

1. **Create virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook random_forest_evaluation.ipynb
   ```

## Technical Requirements

The notebook uses the following key libraries:
- **pandas & numpy**: Data manipulation and numerical operations
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
- **matplotlib**: Static visualizations and plots
- **scipy**: Statistical functions (skewness calculation)

## Educational Value

This project is ideal for:
- **Data Science Students**: Learning proper model evaluation techniques
- **ML Practitioners**: Understanding Random Forest behavior and interpretation
- **Business Analysts**: Connecting technical metrics to business insights
- **Portfolio Development**: Demonstrating comprehensive analytical skills

## Key Methodological Approaches

### 1. **Multi-Metric Evaluation**
- Uses complementary metrics (MAE for interpretability, RMSE for error magnitude, R² for variance explained)
- Provides business-friendly interpretations in dollar terms

### 2. **Visual Analysis**
- Actual vs Predicted scatter plots reveal systematic patterns
- Residual histograms check for normality assumptions
- Sorted residual plots identify bias across price ranges

### 3. **Feature Interpretation**
- Random Forest feature importance with domain knowledge validation
- Discussion of feature correlations and shared importance
- Business relevance of top predictors

### 4. **Data Quality Assessment**
- Impact analysis of skewed distributions
- Clipped value identification and bias discussion
- Preprocessing recommendations

## Results Summary

### Strengths
- Strong overall performance (R² = 0.80)
- Robust to data distribution issues
- Interpretable feature importance
- Good generalization (train/test consistency)

### Limitations
- Systematic bias across price ranges
- Impact of clipped values at $500k
- Feature correlation not explicitly analyzed
- Single algorithm evaluation

### Recommendations
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Consider removing or handling clipped values
2. **Feature Engineering**: Investigate feature correlations
3. **Model Comparison**: Compare with other regression algorithms
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize Random Forest parameters

## Business Applications

This analysis demonstrates techniques applicable to:
- **Real Estate Valuation**: Automated property price estimation
- **Market Analysis**: Understanding key price drivers
- **Investment Decisions**: Risk assessment based on prediction confidence
- **Policy Analysis**: Geographic and demographic factors in housing markets

## Advanced Extensions

Consider exploring:
- **Cross-validation** for more robust performance estimates
- **Hyperparameter optimization** using GridSearch or RandomizedSearch
- **Model ensemble** combining Random Forest with other algorithms
- **Feature engineering** creating interaction terms or geographic clusters
- **Time series analysis** if temporal data is available
